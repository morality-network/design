# Design 1.0 

This project serves as playground for some of our ideas. It also serves as a baseline for our final application/s. At the moment, this is designed in Sketch and we are prototyping within the co-operative using invision. 

This is by no means all of our deisgn components  and is not the limit of our research and prototype implementation. This is a playground to test out some ideas and get most of the components out that can be reused (once converted) in later application implementation. There is no guarantee any of this work at the point at which it is downloaded. This is spoken about above, a work in progress.
