# Design 1.0 

This project serves as playground for some of our ideas. It also serves as a baseline for our final application/s. At the moment, this is designed in Sketch and we are prototyping within the co-operative using invision. 

Guidelines for community members will be released alongside the network on 05/11/20. These guidelines will help individuals and organisations create content within Morality or use our design and guidelines in their own 3rd party applications.
